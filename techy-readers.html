<h1>Techy Readers Concept Page</h1>
<h2>- A Remote Book Reading Club -</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>My wife asked me once: do you still read as much as you talk?</p>

<p>Next day I started Techy Readers, to force myself to read a small bit of technical material every week. Usually not more than I can read on one Metro trip to work in the morning.</p>


<h3>Language:</h3>
<p>Techy Readers is currently only ran in Romanian. Despite the requests to convert it to English, I feel it has more impact on Romanians if it's delivered in the mother tongue. The topics are often quite 'human', about attitudes, and special 'moving' words are useful many times.</p>

<h3>Target Audience:</h3>
<p>People at the start of their career, in need of guidance about what being a Professional programmer really means, as well as experienced practitioners looking for a reinforcement on driving principles, phylosophy, ethics and attitude.</p>

<h3>Why books?</h3>
<p>Although online trainings, talks, or other videos do provide a lot of value, most of the good ideas are eventually summarized in a book or article. While recorded material may provide more impact, published written material tends to be regarded as a better 'reference' in discussions or emails. So one side-effect of Techy Readers is arming the listeners with strong ideas/quotes to use in their debates or emails while fighting for more Professionalism in their daily practice.</p>
<p>Another valuable side efect is delivering a reading idea in the BSCC members's inbox every week, proving them that others are learning.</p>

<h3>Main Topics:</h3>
<p>Books or articles on:</p>
<p>- Principles of Software Engineering and Design (programming language agnostic): DRY, SRP, KISS, SOLID, testing, architecture</p>
<p>- Phylosophy and Attitude: how should a Professional Programmer behave at work</p>
<p>- Extreme Programming Technical Practices: TDD, pair programming, refactoring, estimates</p>
<p>- Coaching/Training topics: how to better share your knowledge to others</p>
<p>- Any other topics that you are passioned about, that can help a Programmer become better. Please propose it!</p>

<h3>Structure:</h3>
<p>During the week, the next TechyReaders event is published containing a link to the chapter to read by next Monday. The participants who want to attend read the chapter, and extract several parts that they like most. Then, they post those quotes on the event page. </p>
<p>Normally, the event takes around 30 minutes and is held on Monday at 12:30. The episode is a monologue: only one speaker talks.</p>
<p>During the first part of the episode, the speaker discusses the quotes posted on the event page by the participants, explaining, drawing parallels, and mentioning as often as possible past experiences and examples.</p>
<p>For the second part of the episode, the speaker discusses and points he/she considers most important from the text (his/her own notes)</p>

<h3>The Speaker:</h3>
<p>I asked dozens of members of our community to step up and speak at a Techy Readers episode. What one needs is only the ability to summarize and convey a clear message in a monologue, for 30 minutes. Although some previous public speaking experience is desirable, anyone with enough passion for a topic can drive an excellent episode. So, just drop me an email at victorrentea@gmail.com to get started.</p>
<p>Important: don't assume the audience has read the chapter, talk without requiring any prior knowledge of the chapter. This will encourage the majority of attendees (normally lacking the necessary time) to continue attending. </p>
